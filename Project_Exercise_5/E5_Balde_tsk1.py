# The aim:
# Individual work, expected 5-10 hours including lectures.
# The aim is to learn to connect the Pico W to local WiFi network and to calculate basic HRV analysis parameters.

# Task 1:
# Write code that connects your protoboard to ICT laboratoryâ€™s WiFi network and displays the IP address on the OLED.
