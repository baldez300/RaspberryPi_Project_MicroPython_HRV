# EXECISE_3 
# This task is divided into two parts that can be completed separately and then integrated into a complete solution.

# Part 1. Implement a program that uses Piotimer and ADC to sample PPG signal at 250Hz frequency
# and passes the sampled data to the main program. In the first phase main program can just print each sample so that you can,
# for example with the data with Thonnyâ€™s plotter view.

# Part 2. Implement an algorithm that finds the heart rate from sampled PPG signal.
# The program should work with the sensor when it is returned to OMA.
